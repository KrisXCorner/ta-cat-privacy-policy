# Privacy Policy for TA Cat Extension

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-20

## 1. Information We Collect
- **Solana Contract Addresses**: When you enter a token contract address for analysis, it is temporarily processed by our backend (Heroku) but not stored.
- **Local Storage Data**: Your UI preferences (e.g., theme, language) are saved locally via Chrome's `storage.sync` API.
- **Analytics**: Anonymous usage metrics (e.g., feature clicks) are collected via [Google Analytics 4].

## 2. How We Use Data
- To provide token analysis results.
- To improve extension functionality (e.g., fix bugs based on error reports).

## 3. Data Sharing
- **No third-party sharing**: All data stays between your browser and our Heroku backend.
- **Exceptions**: Data may be disclosed if required by law.

## 4. Security
- All API calls use HTTPS encryption.
- Backend data is automatically deleted after processing.

## 5. Your Rights
- Clear local data: Uninstall the extension or use Chrome's storage settings.
